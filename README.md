# Ryte

Ryte is a library for generating bytecoe for various platforms.
Currently, MOS 6502 and Motorola 68k support is planned.

As well as providing low-level support for each individual system,
Ryte also exposes a higher level api for generating cross-platform
code, in a manner similar to libjit or lightning.

## Usage
`ryte <file> [-s system]`
